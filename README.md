# Template Java project Dev
Little project to give a Template project to anyone wanting to devekop Java applications.
The project will include Unittest with JUnit, Gradle for building and managing the
dependencies on Maven. More technologies will be added in the future along with the
evolution of the project.

# Main developers
If you have any question about the project or anything that comes to your mind,
please feel free to contact me.
I guess mine is @kounkou... ^^

# Contributions
Contributions are very welcome, but rules exist for them :-)
Here are the steps to follow if you use the command line.

```shell
# clone the project
$ git clone git@github.com:[github login]/Template-Java.git

# create your dev branch
$ git branch branch-name-here

# push the newly created branch to origin
$ git push -u origin branch-name-here

# switch to your newly created branch for development
$ git checkout branch-name-here

```

Then you just need to work on your idea... and send me a pull request.

Voil√† !
